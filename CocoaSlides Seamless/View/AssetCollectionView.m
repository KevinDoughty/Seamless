Abstract: An AssetCollectionView displays a collection of Assets, each represented by an AssetViewCollectionViewNode that manages a small view subtree.  Specifically, this is the view in Cocoa Slides that displays the gray gradient (or Quartz Composition) background, and serves as a container view for the "slides".
