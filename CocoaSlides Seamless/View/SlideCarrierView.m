Abstract: A SlideCarrierView serves as the root view for each Asset's visual representation.  It draws a filled rounded-rect background, with a transparent cutout behind the slide's NSImageView, and mainly serves as a container view.  A SlideCarrierView also maintains a reference to the Asset that the slide represents.

Other fun filters you might want to try include "CIBloom" and "CISepiaTone".

    } // Else, "filters" will be left as nil, and setContentFilters: below will remove the view's previously assigned contentFilters.

    // When applying the highlight effect (highlight == YES), we want the change in appearance to take effect immediately.  When unhighlighting (highlight == NO), however, we'd like for the removal of the filter effect to fade out gradually instead of being instantaneous.  There are two ways you can apply such a change without animating.  One is to set the enclosing NSAnimationContext's "duration" to zero, as we do below when "highlight" is true.  Another would be to message the view directly to make the contentFilters change, rather than messaging through the view's animator.  Doing "[self setContentFilters:filters]" (as with setting any other view property directly, without going through the animator) always has an instantaneous effect, regardless of the enclosing NSAnimationContext's duration.
